Constructor in Java
A constructor in Java is a special method that is automatically invoked when an object of a class is created. Its main purpose is to initialize objects and assign values to instance variables at the time of creation. Unlike normal methods, a constructor does not have a return type, not even void, and its name must be the same as the class name.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Characteristics of a Constructor
1)The name of the constructor must be the same as the class.
2)A constructor does not have a return type.
3)It is executed automatically when an object is created.
4)If no constructor is defined, Java provides a default one automatically.
5)Constructors can be overloaded by providing different parameter lists.

Types of Constructors
1)Default Constructor – A constructor without parameters that assigns default values to objects.
2)Parameterized Constructor – A constructor that accepts arguments to initialize an object with specific values.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Constructor Overloading
1)A class can have multiple constructors with different parameter lists.
2)This allows objects to be created in various ways.
3)It improves flexibility and readability of the program.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Constructor Chaining
1)Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another within the same class using the this() keyword.
2)It reduces code duplication and improves reusability.

Difference Between Constructor and Method
Name: Constructor has the same name as the class, while methods can have any name.
Return Type: Constructor has no return type, but methods must have one.
Execution: Constructor runs automatically at object creation, whereas methods are explicitly called.
Purpose: Constructors initialize objects, methods perform specific tasks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Importance of Constructors
1)They ensure that objects start in a valid and consistent state.
2)They simplify object creation by providing initialization logic.
3)They improve readability, maintainability, and flexibility through overloading.
4)They support reusability and cleaner design with constructor chaining.
